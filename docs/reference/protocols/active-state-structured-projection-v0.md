# active_state_structured_projection_v0

`active_state_structured_projection_v0` is a read model for
`ACTIVE_GOAL_STATE.md`. It keeps Markdown as the human/agent workbench while
exposing typed todo, gate, next-action, and migration diagnostics for status,
quota, review packets, dashboards, and future event-store migration.

This is not a new canonical store. The projection is recomputable from the
current active-state Markdown and does not grant write permission.

The machine-owned Todo read subset is versioned separately in
`coordination_state_contract_v0.json`. That provider-neutral contract is shared
by Python and TypeScript. It declares the legacy consumer record and a separate
native domain record for file, NoKV, or PostgreSQL authority heads.
`archive_state` is durable task state: archival changes handoff and succession
eligibility independently of completion. `source_section` and optional `index`
belong to the Markdown compatibility projection, not native creation inputs.
Legacy v0 records retain those fields; importing them into the domain version
requires explicit qualification, including preservation of priority tie ordering
currently influenced by `index`. There is no automatic stored-head migration.
Provider-bound projection rejects an unknown
field instead of silently dropping it. Removing a declared field requires a
reviewed compatibility decision and maintainer approval, including for fields
that are persisted but not yet used by a decision path.

## Todo Items

Todo items use the existing `todo_item_v0` fields where possible:

- `todo_id`, `todo_id_source`, `role`, `status`, `done`;
- `priority`, `title`, `task_class`, `action_kind`, `continuation_policy`;
- `claimed_by`, `blocks_agent`, `global_gate`, `unblocks_todo_id`;
- `resume_when`, `no_followup`;
- monitor metadata such as `target_key`, `cadence`, `next_due_at`, and
  `consecutive_no_change`;
- compact evidence fields such as `note`, `evidence`, `reason`,
  `completed_at`, and `updated_at`.

`todo_id_source=metadata` means the item carried explicit LoopX metadata.
`todo_id_source=generated` means the projection generated a stable compatibility
id from role, source section, index, and text. Generated ids are useful for
read compatibility but are not migration-ready.

## Diagnostics

Diagnostics are intentionally small and machine-readable:

| Diagnostic | Severity | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `missing_frontmatter` | warning | Markdown lacks frontmatter such as status or updated time. |
| `missing_next_action` | warning | No `## Next Action` entries were projected. |
| `missing_todo_sections` | warning | No user or agent todo items were projected. |
| `implicit_todo_ids` | warning | Some todo ids were generated instead of explicit metadata ids. |
| `duplicate_todo_ids` | error | Multiple items use the same explicit or generated todo id. |

`migration_ready=true` requires at least one todo item, no errors, and no
implicit todo ids. A non-ready projection can still be useful for status and
operator displays; it should not be promoted as canonical event-store input.

## Reader Contract

Readers should treat this projection as:

- read-only;
- public-safe only after normal `loopx check` / boundary scanning;
- a compatibility layer over Markdown, not a replacement for todo/event write
  APIs;
- a bridge for parity tests before moving active-state parsing out of
  `status.py`.

Writers must continue to use LoopX commands such as `loopx todo`,
`loopx refresh-state`, `loopx operator-gate`, and future event append APIs.
Directly editing a projection is not a state transition.

## Markdown Ownership Boundary

Markdown is not one undifferentiated database row. Its free-form rationale,
notes, and operator narrative remain human-authored. Sections that correspond
to the versioned coordination contract may later be regenerated as a
deterministic compatibility projection after authority promotion. Promotion
must not make unrelated prose generated or discard text that is outside the
machine-owned record contract.

The cutover is deliberately section-sized, not document-sized:

- before promotion, Markdown remains the authority and existing writers are
  unchanged;
- after promotion, the versioned Todo records live in the canonical provider
  head and Markdown's Todo section is a compatibility/workbench projection;
- free-form rationale and operator narrative remain Markdown-owned;
- a provider outage after promotion fails closed and never makes stale
  Markdown authoritative again.

The first write using this boundary is Todo claim. It exercises a complete
provider-neutral TypeScript transaction while leaving the default local path
unchanged. Deterministic Markdown regeneration is a later migration step, not
an implicit side effect of promotion.

## Migration Path

1. Emit this projection from active-state Markdown.
2. Add parity smokes comparing it with existing status todo summaries.
3. Move Markdown parsing into a dedicated active-state read-model module behind
   the same projection fields.
4. Promote one complete provider-backed mutation at a time behind the durable
   writer fence; keep the default Markdown mode unchanged.
5. Regenerate only machine-owned sections from canonical state, preserving
   human narrative and validating parse/render parity.
6. Promote a provider projection only after rollback and idempotency checks are
   in place.
